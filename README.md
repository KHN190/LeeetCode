# Leeetcode

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/KHN190/LeeetCode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/KHN190/LeeetCode)

Started since I need a job. Turns out it's not boring.

## Run

```bash
python3 run_all.py
```

## Todo

* regex matching implementation
* LC261 cpu cycle

## Notes to myself

Learn to code, as well learn to explain.

Optimal solutions should always be studied. Since looks that in interview, only 1~2 will be allowed not to be optimal among five rounds of code test.

## Progress

8 months, ~200 problems, that's 6.25 problems per week.
* 14 problems. Sep 3, 2021. (7%)
* 21 problems. Sep 11, 2021. (10.5%)
* 28 problems. Sep 21, 2021. (14%)
