Started since I need a job. Turns out it's not boring.

## Run

```bash
python3 run_all.py
```

Google's interview covers 50% medium, 50% hard. The "hard" problems are not generally too hard to solve, and "easy" problems are not always easy to solve. They are labeled hard because the problems can be optimized in further steps and easy problems has a straightforward optimal solution. Variants / follow-ups can add one more constraint to the original na√Øve problem.

For practicing, optimal solutions should always be studied. Since in real interview, only 1~2 will be allowed not to be optimal among five rounds of code test.

Also learn to explain your thoughts to people.
