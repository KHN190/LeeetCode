# Leeetcode

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/KHN190/LeeetCode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/KHN190/LeeetCode)

Started since I need a job. Turns out it's not boring.

## Run

```bash
python3 run_all.py
```

## Todo

And prep for [system designs](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/tree/master/experimental/design).

## Notes to myself

Learn to code, as well learn to explain.

Optimal solutions should always be studied. Since looks that in interview, only 1~2 will be allowed not to be optimal among five rounds of code test.
