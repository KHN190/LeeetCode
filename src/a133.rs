// https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/

// Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.
// Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

// adjacency list: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// or: [[]], single node graph

// The number of nodes in the graph is in the range [0, 100].
// Node.val is unique for each node. and equals its index.
// There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
// The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.
