// https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/

// Given a string s, consider all duplicated substrings:
// (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times.
// The occurrences may overlap.

// Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.
// If s does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".

// 2 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4
// s consists of lowercase English letters.

// Thoughts:
//

pub fn longest_dup_substring(s: String) -> String {
    "".into()
}
